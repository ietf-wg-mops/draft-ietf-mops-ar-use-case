	  A use case describing transmission of an application on the Internet that has several 
	  unique characteristics of Augmented Reality
	  (AR) applications is presented for the consideration 
	  of the Media Operations (MOPS) Working Group.  One key
	   requirement identified is that the Adaptive-Bit-Rate (ABR) algorithms' current usage of 
        policies based on heuristics and models is inadequate for AR applications running on the Edge Computing infrastructure.

	  <t>
		The MOPS draft, <xref target="I-D.ietf-mops-streaming-opcons" />, provides an overview of operational networking issues
		that pertain to Quality of Experience (QoE) in delivery of video and other high-bitrate media over the Internet.  However, as it
		does not cover the increasingly large number of applications with Augmented Reality (AR) characteristics and 
		their requirements on ABR algorithms, the discussion in this draft compliments the overview 
		presented in that draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-mops-streaming-opcons" />.
      </t>      
	  
	  <t>
	    Future AR applications will bring several requirements for the Internet and the
		mobile devices running these applications. AR applications require a real-time processing of video streams to
		recognize specific objects. This is then used to overlay information on the
		video being displayed to the user.  In addition some AR applications will also require generation of new video
		frames to be played to the user. Both the real-time processing of video streams and the generation of overlay information 
		are computationally intensive tasks that generate heat <xref target="DEV_HEAT_1"/>, <xref target="DEV_HEAT_2"/> 
		and drain battery power <xref target="BATT_DRAIN"/> on the AR mobile device.
		Consequently, in order to run future applications with AR characteristics
		on mobile devices, computationally intensive tasks need to be offloaded to resources provided by Edge Computing.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
		Edge Computing is an emerging paradigm where computing resources and storage are made available in close 
		network proximity at the edge of the Internet to mobile devices and sensors <xref target="EDGE_1"/>, <xref target="EDGE_2"/>. 
      </t>
	  
	   <t>
		Adaptive-Bit-Rate (ABR) algorithms currently base their policy for bit-rate selection on heuristics or models 
		of the deployment environment that do not account for the environment's dynamic nature in use cases such as the 
		one we present in this document. Consequently, the ABR algorithms perform sub-optimally in such deployments <xref target="ABR_1"/>.

    </section>

	<section anchor="use_case" title="Use Case">
	     <t> 
		 We now describe a use case that involves an application with 
		 AR systems' characteristics. Consider a group of tourists who are being 
		 conducted in a tour around the historical site of the Tower of London.
		 As they move around the site and within the historical buildings, they can
		 watch and listen to historical scenes in 3D that are generated by the AR application and then
		 overlaid by their AR headsets onto their real-world view. The headset then continuously updates their view as they move around.
		 </t>
		
		<t>
		The AR  application first processes the scene that the walking tourist is watching in real-time and identifies objects 
		that will be targeted for overlay of high resolution videos. It then generates high resolution 3D images
		of historical scenes  related to the perspective of the tourist in real-time. These generated video images are then
		overlaid on the view of the real-world as seen by the tourist. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		We now discuss this  processing of scenes
		and generation of high resolution images in greater detail.
		
		</t>
		
		<section anchor="processsing_of_scenes" title="Processing of Scenes">
		
		<t>
		The task of processing a scene can be broken down into a pipeline of three consecutive subtasks namely tracking, followed by an acquisition of a
		model of the real world, and finally registration <xref target="AUGMENTED"/>.
		
		</t>
		
		<t>
		Tracking: This includes tracking of the three dimensional coordinates and six dimensional pose (coordinates and orientation)
		of objects in the real world<xref target="AUGMENTED"/>.
		The AR application that runs on the mobile device needs to track the pose 
		of the user's head, eyes and the 
		objects that are in view.This requires tracking natural features that are then used in the next stage of the pipeline.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		Acquisition of a model of the real world: The tracked natural features are used to develop an annotated
		point cloud based model that is then stored in a database.To ensure that this database can be scaled up,techniques such as 
		combining a client side simultaneous tracking and mapping and a server-side localization 
		are used<xref target="SLAM_1"/>, <xref target="SLAM_2"/>, <xref target="SLAM_3"/>, <xref target="SLAM_4"/>. 
		</t>
		
		
		
		<t>
		Registration: The coordinate systems, brightness, and color
		of virtual and real objects need to be aligned in a process called registration <xref target="REG"/>.
		Once the 
		natural features are tracked as discussed above, virtual objects are geometrically aligned with those features by geometric registration
		.This is followed by 
		resolving occlusion that can occur between virtual and the real objects <xref target="OCCL_1"/>, <xref target="OCCL_2"/>.
		
		The AR application also applies photometric registration <xref target="PHOTO_REG"/>
		by aligning the brightness and color between the virtual and
		real objects.Additionally, algorithms that calculate global illumination of both the virtual and real objects <xref target="GLB_ILLUM_1"/>, 
		<xref target="GLB_ILLUM_2"/> are executed.Various algorithms to deal with artifacts generated by lens distortion <xref target="LENS_DIST"/>, 
		blur <xref target="BLUR"/>, noise <xref target="NOISE"/> etc are also required.
        </t>
		 </section>
		
		<section anchor="generation" title="Generation of Images">
		
		<t>
		The AR application must generate a high-quality video that has the properties described in the previous step
		and overlay the video on the AR device's display- a step called situated visualization.	This entails  dealing with registration errors that
		may arise, ensuring that there is no visual interference <xref target="VIS_INTERFERE"/>, and finally maintaining 
		temporal coherence by adapting to the movement of user's eyes and head.
		</t>
		
		 </section>
		 
    </section>
	
	
	
	<section anchor="Req" title="Requirements">   
	<t>
	The components of AR applications perform tasks such as real-time generation and processing of
		high-quality video content that are computationally intensive. As a result,on AR devices such as AR glasses 
		excessive heat is generated by the chip-sets that are involved 
		in the computation <xref target="DEV_HEAT_1"/>, <xref target="DEV_HEAT_2"/>.  Additionally, 
		the battery on such devices discharges quickly when running
		such applications <xref target="BATT_DRAIN"/>.
	
	</t>
	<t>
	A solution to the heat dissipation and battery drainage problem is to offload the processing and video generation tasks
	to the remote cloud.However, running such tasks on the cloud is not feasible as the end-to-end delays 
		must be within the order of a few milliseconds. Additionally,such applications require high bandwidth 
		and low jitter to provide a high QoE to the user.In order to achieve such hard timing constraints, computationally intensive
		tasks can be offloaded to Edge devices.
	
	</t>
	<t>
	
	Another requirement for our use case and similar applications such as 360 degree streaming is that the display on 
	the AR/VR device should synchronize the visual input with the way the user is moving their head. This synchronization 
	is necessary to avoid motion sickness that results from a time-lag between when the user moves their head and
	when the appropriate video scene is rendered. This time lag is often called “motion-to-photon” delay.
Studies have shown <xref target="PER_SENSE"/>, <xref target="XR"/>, <xref target="OCCL_3"/> that this delay 
can be at most 20ms and preferably between 7-15ms in 
order to avoid the motion sickness problem. Out of these 20ms, display techniques including the refresh 
rate of write displays and pixel switching take 12-13ms <xref target="OCCL_3"/>, <xref target="CLOUD"/>. This leaves 7-8ms for the processing of 
motion sensor inputs, graphic rendering, and RTT between the AR/VR device and the Edge.
The use of predictive techniques to mask latencies has been considered as a mitigating strategy to reduce motion sickness <xref target="PREDICT"/>.
In addition, Edge Devices that are proximate to the user might be used to offload these computationally intensive tasks. 
Towards this end, the 3GPP requires and supports an Ultra Reliable Low Latency of 0.1ms to 1ms for 
communication between an Edge server and User Equipment(UE)  <xref target="URLLC"/>.


	
	</t>
	
		
		<t>
		Note that the Edge device providing the computation and storage is itself limited in such resources compared to the Cloud.  So, 
		for example, a sudden surge in demand from a large group of tourists can overwhelm that device. This will result in a degraded user
		 experience as their AR device experiences delays in receiving the video frames. In order to deal 
		 with this problem, the client AR applications will need to use Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) algorithms that choose bit-rates policies
		 tailored in a fine-grained manner 
		 to the resource demands and playback the videos with appropriate QoE metrics as the user moves around with the group of tourists.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		However, heavy-tailed nature of several  operational parameters make prediction-based  adaptation by ABR algorithms sub-optimal<xref target="ABR_2"/>. 
		This is because with such distributions, law of large numbers works too slowly, the mean of sample does not equal the mean of distribution, 
		and as a result standard deviation and variance are unsuitable as metrics for such operational parameters <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1"/>, 
		<xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_2"/>. Other subtle issues with 
		these distributions include the "expectation paradox" <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1"/> where the longer we have waited for an event the 
		longer we have to wait and the 
		issue of mismatch between the size and count of events <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1"/>. This makes designing an algorithm for 
		adaptation error-prone and challenging. 
		Such operational parameters include but are not limited to buffer occupancy, throughput, client-server latency, and variable transmission 
		times.In addition, edge devices and communication links  may fail and logical communication relationships between various software components 
		change frequently as the user moves around with their AR device <xref target="UBICOMP"/>.
		
		</t>

		<t>
        Thus, once the offloaded computationally intensive processing is completed on the Edge Computing, the video is streamed to the
		user with the help of an ABR algorithm which needs to meet the following requirements <xref target="ABR_1"/>: 
			
			<list style="symbols">
			   <t>Dynamically changing ABR parameters: The ABR algorithm must be able to dynamically change parameters given the 
			   heavy-tailed nature of network throughput.  This, for example, may be accomplished by AI/ML processing on the Edge Computing
			   on a per client or global basis.
			   </t>
			   
			   <t>Handling conflicting QoE requirements: QoE goals often require high bit-rates, and low frequency of buffer refills. However
			   in practice, this can lead to a conflict between those goals. For example, increasing the bit-rate might 
			   result in the need to fill up the buffer more frequently as the buffer capacity might be limited on the AR device.  
			   The ABR algorithm must be able to handle this situation.</t>
			   
			   <t>Handling side effects of deciding a specific bit rate: For example, selecting a bit rate of a particular value might result
			   in the ABR algorithm not changing to a different rate so as to ensure a non-fluctuating bit-rate and the 
			   resultant smoothness of video quality . The ABR algorithm must be able to handle this situation.</t>
			   
			</list> 
		</t>

	<section anchor="ArTraffic" title="AR Network Traffic and Interaction with TCP">  
	
	<t>
	In addition to the requirements for ABR algorithms, there are other operational issues that need to 
	be considered for AR use cases such as the one descibed above. In a study <xref target="AR_TRAFFIC"/> conducted to characterize
	multi-user AR over cellular networks, the following issues were identified:
	<list style="symbols">
			   <t>The uploading of data from an AR device to a remote server for processing dominates the end-to-end latency.
			   </t>
			   
			   <t> A lack of visual features in the grid environment can cause increased latencies as the AR device
			   uploads additional visual data for processing to the remote server.</t>
			   
			   <t>AR applications tend to have large bursts that are separated by significant time gaps.
			   As a result, the TCP congestion window enters slow start before the large bursts of data arrive
			    increasing the perceived user latency. The study <xref target="AR_TRAFFIC"/> shows that segmentation latency at 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution)'s 
				RAN (Radio Access Network)'s RLC (Radio Link Control) layer impacts TCP's performance during slow-start.</t>
