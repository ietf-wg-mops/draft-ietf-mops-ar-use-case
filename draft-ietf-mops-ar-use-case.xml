		This document explores the issues involved in the use of Edge Computing resources to operationalize media use cases
		that involve Extended Reality (XR) applications. In particular, we discuss those applications that run on devices having different
		form factors and need Edge computing resources to mitigate the effect of problems such as a need to support interactive communication
		requiring low latency, limited battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices. The intended audience for this document are network
		operators who are interested in providing edge computing resources to operationalize the requirements of such applications.
		We discuss the expected behavior of XR applications which can be used to manage the traffic.
		In addition, we discuss the service requirements of XR applications to be able to run on the network.

      <t>
		Extended Reality (XR) is a term that includes Augmented Realty (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Realty (MR) <xref target="XR" format="default"/>.
		AR combines the real and virtual, is interactive and is aligned to the physical world of the user <xref target="AUGMENTED_2" format="default"/>. On the other hand,
		VR places the user inside a virtual environment generated by a computer <xref target="AUGMENTED" format="default"/>.MR merges the real and virtual world along a
		continuum that connects completely real environment at one end to a completely virtual environment at the other end. In this continuum, all
		combinations of the real and virtual are captured <xref target="AUGMENTED" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	    XR applications will bring several requirements for the network and the
		mobile devices running these applications. Some XR applications such as AR require a real-time processing of video streams to
		recognize specific objects. This is then used to overlay information on the
		video being displayed to the user.  In addition XR applications such as AR and VR will also require generation of new video
		frames to be played to the user. Both the real-time processing of video streams and the generation of overlay information
		are computationally intensive tasks that generate heat <xref target="DEV_HEAT_1" format="default"/>, <xref target="DEV_HEAT_2" format="default"/>
		and drain battery power <xref target="BATT_DRAIN" format="default"/> on the mobile device running the XR application.
		Consequently, in order to run applications with XR characteristics
		on mobile devices, computationally intensive tasks need to be offloaded to resources provided by Edge Computing.
      </t>
      <t>
		Edge Computing is an emerging paradigm where computing resources and storage are made available in close
		network proximity at the edge of the Internet to mobile devices and sensors <xref target="EDGE_1" format="default"/>, <xref target="EDGE_2" format="default"/>.
		These edge computing devices use cloud technologies that enable them to support offloaded XR applications. In particular, the edge devices deploy
		cloud computing implementation techniques such as disaggregation (breaking vertically integrated systems into independent components with open interfaces
		using SDN), virtualization (being able to run multiple independent copies of those components such as SDN Controller apps, Virtual Network Functions on a
		common hardware platform) and commoditization ( being able to elastically scale those virtual components across commodity hardware as the workload dictates)
		<xref target="EDGE_3" format="default"/>. Such techniques enable XR applications requiring low-latency and high bandwidth to be delivered by mini-clouds
		running on proximate edge devices
      </t>
      <t>
	  In this document, we discuss the issues involved when edge computing resources are offered by network operators to
	  operationalize the requirements of XR applications running on devices with various form factors. Examples of such form factors
	  include Head Mounted Displays (HMD) such as Optical-see through HMDs and video-see-through HMDs and Hand-held displays.
	  Smart phones with video cameras and GPS are another example of such devices. These devices have limited
	  battery capacity and dissipate heat when running. Besides as the user of these devices moves around as they run the
	  XR application, the wireless latency and bandwidth available to the devices fluctuates and the communication link itself
	  might fail. As a result algorithms such as those based on adaptive-bit-rate techniques that base their policy on heuristics
	  or models of deployment perform sub-optimally in such dynamic environments<xref target="ABR_1" format="default"/>.
	  In addition, network operators can expect that the parameters that characterize the expected behavior of XR applications
	  are heavy-tailed. Such workloads require appropriate resource management policies to be used on the Edge.
	  The service requirements of XR applications are also challenging when compared to the current video applications.
	  In particular several QoE factors such as motion sickness are unique to XR applications and must be considered when operationalizing a network.

		We motivate these issues with a use-case that we present in the following sections.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="convention" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Conventions used in this document</name>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
		"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" format="default"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="use_case" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Use Case</name>
      <t>
		 We now describe a use case that involves an application with
		 AR systems' characteristics. Consider a group of tourists who are being
		 conducted in a tour around the historical site of the Tower of London.
		 As they move around the site and within the historical buildings, they can
		 watch and listen to historical scenes in 3D that are generated by the AR application and then
		 overlaid by their AR headsets onto their real-world view. The headset then continuously updates their view as they move around.
      </t>
      <t>
		The AR  application first processes the scene that the walking tourist is watching in real-time and identifies objects
		that will be targeted for overlay of high resolution videos. It then generates high resolution 3D images
		of historical scenes  related to the perspective of the tourist in real-time. These generated video images are then
		overlaid on the view of the real-world as seen by the tourist.
      </t>
      <t>
		We now discuss this  processing of scenes
		and generation of high resolution images in greater detail.
		
      </t>
      <section anchor="processsing_of_scenes" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Processing of Scenes</name>
        <t>
		The task of processing a scene can be broken down into a pipeline of three consecutive subtasks namely tracking, followed by an acquisition of a
		model of the real world, and finally registration <xref target="AUGMENTED" format="default"/>.
		
        </t>
        <t>
		Tracking: This includes tracking of the three dimensional coordinates and six dimensional pose (coordinates and orientation)
		of objects in the real world<xref target="AUGMENTED" format="default"/>.
		The AR application that runs on the mobile device needs to track the pose
		of the user's head, eyes and the
		objects that are in view.This requires tracking natural features that are then used in the next stage of the pipeline.
        </t>
        <t>
		Acquisition of a model of the real world: The tracked natural features are used to develop an annotated
		point cloud based model that is then stored in a database.To ensure that this database can be scaled up,techniques such as
		combining a client side simultaneous tracking and mapping and a server-side localization
		are used<xref target="SLAM_1" format="default"/>, <xref target="SLAM_2" format="default"/>, <xref target="SLAM_3" format="default"/>, <xref target="SLAM_4" format="default"/>.Another model that can be built is based on polygon mesh and texture mapping technique. The polygon mesh encodes a 3D object's shape which is expressed as a collection of small flat surfaces that are polygons. In texture mapping, color patterns are mapped on to an object's surface. A third modelling technique uses a 2D lightfield that describes the intensity or color of the light rays arriving at a single point from arbitrary directions. Assuming distant light sources, the single point is approximately valid for small scenes. For larger scenes, a 5D lightfield is used which encodes seperate 2D lightfields for many 3D positions in space <xref target="AUGMENTED" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
		Registration: The coordinate systems, brightness, and color
		of virtual and real objects need to be aligned in a process called registration <xref target="REG" format="default"/>.
		Once the
		natural features are tracked as discussed above, virtual objects are geometrically aligned with those features by geometric registration
		.This is followed by
		resolving occlusion that can occur between virtual and the real objects <xref target="OCCL_1" format="default"/>, <xref target="OCCL_2" format="default"/>.
		
		The AR application also applies photometric registration <xref target="PHOTO_REG" format="default"/>
		by aligning the brightness and color between the virtual and
		real objects.Additionally, algorithms that calculate global illumination of both the virtual and real objects <xref target="GLB_ILLUM_1" format="default"/>,
		<xref target="GLB_ILLUM_2" format="default"/> are executed.Various algorithms to deal with artifacts generated by lens distortion <xref target="LENS_DIST" format="default"/>,
		blur <xref target="BLUR" format="default"/>, noise <xref target="NOISE" format="default"/> etc are also required.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="generation" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Generation of Images</name>
        <t>
		The AR application must generate a high-quality video that has the properties described in the previous step
		and overlay the video on the AR device's display- a step called situated visualization.	This entails  dealing with registration errors that
		may arise, ensuring that there is no visual interference <xref target="VIS_INTERFERE" format="default"/>, and finally maintaining
		temporal coherence by adapting to the movement of user's eyes and head.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Req" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Requirements</name>
      <t>
	The components of AR applications perform tasks such as real-time generation and processing of
		high-quality video content that are computationally intensive. As a result,on AR devices such as AR glasses
		excessive heat is generated by the chip-sets that are involved
		in the computation <xref target="DEV_HEAT_1" format="default"/>, <xref target="DEV_HEAT_2" format="default"/>.  Additionally,
		the battery on such devices discharges quickly when running
		such applications <xref target="BATT_DRAIN" format="default"/>.
	
      </t>
      <t>
	A solution to the heat dissipation and battery drainage problem is to offload the processing and video generation tasks
	to the remote cloud.However, running such tasks on the cloud is not feasible as the end-to-end delays
		must be within the order of a few milliseconds. Additionally,such applications require high bandwidth
		and low jitter to provide a high QoE to the user.In order to achieve such hard timing constraints, computationally intensive
		tasks can be offloaded to Edge devices.
	
      </t>
      <t>
	
	Another requirement for our use case and similar applications such as 360 degree streaming is that the display on
	the AR/VR device should synchronize the visual input with the way the user is moving their head. This synchronization
	is necessary to avoid motion sickness that results from a time-lag between when the user moves their head and
	when the appropriate video scene is rendered. This time lag is often called "motion-to-photon" delay.
Studies have shown <xref target="PER_SENSE" format="default"/>, <xref target="XR" format="default"/>, <xref target="OCCL_3" format="default"/> that this delay
can be at most 20ms and preferably between 7-15ms in
order to avoid the motion sickness problem. Out of these 20ms, display techniques including the refresh
rate of write displays and pixel switching take 12-13ms <xref target="OCCL_3" format="default"/>, <xref target="CLOUD" format="default"/>. This leaves 7-8ms for the processing of
motion sensor inputs, graphic rendering, and RTT between the AR/VR device and the Edge.
The use of predictive techniques to mask latencies has been considered as a mitigating strategy to reduce motion sickness <xref target="PREDICT" format="default"/>.
In addition, Edge Devices that are proximate to the user might be used to offload these computationally intensive tasks.
Towards this end, the 3GPP requires and supports an Ultra Reliable Low Latency of 0.1ms to 1ms for
communication between an Edge server and User Equipment(UE)  <xref target="URLLC" format="default"/>.


	
      </t>
      <t>
		Note that the Edge device providing the computation and storage is itself limited in such resources compared to the Cloud.  So,
		for example, a sudden surge in demand from a large group of tourists can overwhelm that device. This will result in a degraded user
		 experience as their AR device experiences delays in receiving the video frames. In order to deal
		 with this problem, the client AR applications will need to use Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) algorithms that choose bit-rates policies
		 tailored in a fine-grained manner
		 to the resource demands and playback the videos with appropriate QoE metrics as the user moves around with the group of tourists.
      </t>
      <t>
		However, heavy-tailed nature of several  operational parameters make prediction-based  adaptation by ABR algorithms sub-optimal<xref target="ABR_2" format="default"/>.
		This is because with such distributions, law of large numbers works too slowly, the mean of sample does not equal the mean of distribution,
		and as a result standard deviation and variance are unsuitable as metrics for such operational parameters <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1" format="default"/>,
		<xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_2" format="default"/>. Other subtle issues with
		these distributions include the "expectation paradox" <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1" format="default"/> where the longer we have waited for an event the
		longer we have to wait and the
		issue of mismatch between the size and count of events <xref target="HEAVY_TAIL_1" format="default"/>. This makes designing an algorithm for
		adaptation error-prone and challenging.
		Such operational parameters include but are not limited to buffer occupancy, throughput, client-server latency, and variable transmission
		times.In addition, edge devices and communication links  may fail and logical communication relationships between various software components
		change frequently as the user moves around with their AR device <xref target="UBICOMP" format="default"/>.

        <t>
		As discussed earlier, the parameters that capture the characteristics of XR application behavior are heavy-tailed.
		Examples of such parameters include the distribution of arrival times between XR application invocation, the amount
		of data transferred, and the inter-arrival times of packets within a session.As a result, any traffic model based on
		such parameters are themselves heavy-tailed. Using
		these models to predict performance under alternative resource allocations by the network operator is challenging. For example, both uplink and downlink traffic to a UE device has parameters such as volume of XR data, burst time, and idle time that are heavy tailed.
      </t>
      <t>
         <xref target="TABLE_1" format="default"/> below shows various XR applications and their associated throughput requirements <xref target="METRICS_1" format="default"/>. Our use case envisages a 6DoF video or point cloud and so will require 200 to 1000Mbps of bandwidth.
As seen from the table, the XR application such as our use case transmit a larger amount of data per unit time as compared to traditional video applications. As a result, issues arising out of heavy tailed parameters such as long-range dependent traffic <xref target="METRICS_2" format="default"/>, self-similar traffic <xref target="METRICS_3" format="default"/>, would be experienced at time scales of milliseconds and microseconds rather than hours or seconds. Additionally, burstiness at the time scale of tens of milliseconds due to multi-fractal spectrum of traffic will be experienced <xref target="METRICS_4" format="default"/>.
Long-range dependent traffic can have long bursts and various traffic parameters from widely separated time can show correlation. Self-similar traffic contains bursts at a wide range of time scales. Multi-fractal spectrum bursts for traffic summarizes the statistical distribution of local scaling exponents found in a traffic trace.
The operational consequences of XR traffic having characteristics such as long-range dependency, and self-similarity is that the edge servers to which multiple XR devices are connected wirelessly could face long bursts of traffic. In addition, multi-fractal spectrum burstiness at the scale of milli-seconds could induce jitter contributing to motion sickness.
The operators of edge servers will need to run a 'managed edge cloud service' <xref target="METRICS_5" format="default"/> to deal with the above problems. Functionalities that such a managed edge cloud service could operationally provide include dynamic placement of XR servers, mobility support and energy management <xref target="METRICS_6" format="default"/>. Providing Edge server support for the techniques being developed at the DETNET and RAW Working Groups at the IETF could guarantee performance of XR applications.

 Thus, the provisioning of edge servers in terms of the number of servers, the topology, where to place them, the assignment of link capacity, CPUs and GPUs should keep the above factors in mind.

      <t>
	  The performance requirements for AR/VR traffic have characteristics that need to be considered when operationalizing a network.
	  We now discuss these characteristics.</t>
<t>The bandwidth requirements of XR applications are substantially higher than those of video based applications.</t>

	<t>The latency requirements of XR applications have been studied recently  <xref target="AR_TRAFFIC" format="default"/> .The following issues were identified.:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The uploading of data from an AR device to a remote server for processing dominates the end-to-end latency.
			   </li>
        <li> A lack of visual features in the grid environment can cause increased latencies as the AR device
			   uploads additional visual data for processing to the remote server.</li>
        <li>AR applications tend to have large bursts that are separated by significant time gaps.</li>
      </ul>
	
	  <t>The packet loss rates in wireless links between XR devices and the Edge server can be as high as 2% or more  <xref target="WIRELESS_1" format="default"/>. </t>
	 <t> Additionally, XR applications interact with each other on a time scale of a round-trip-time propagation
	  and this must be considered when operationalizing a network.</t>


         <t>
            The following <xref target="TABLE_2" format="default"/> <xref target="METRICS_6" format="default"/> shows a taxonomy of applications with their associated required response times and bandwidths. Response times can
be defined as the time interval between the end of a request submission and the end of the corresponding response from a system. If the XR device offloads a task to an edge server, the response time of the server is the round trip time from when a data packet is sent from the XR device until a response is received. Note that the required response time provides an upper bound on the sum of the time taken by computational tasks such as processing of scenes, generation of images and the round trip time. This response time depends only on the Quality of Service (QOS) required by an application. The response time is therefore independent of the underlying technology of the network and the time taken by the computational tasks.

         </t>
        <t>
Our use case requires a response time of 20ms at most and preferably between 7-15ms as discussed earlier. The required bandwidth for our use case as discussed in section 5.2 is 200Mbps-1000Mbps.
Since our use case envisages multiple users running the XR applications on their devices, and connected to an edge server that is closest to them, these latency and bandwidth connections will grow linearly with the number of users. The operators should match the network provisioning to the maximum number of tourists that can be supported by a link to an edge server.
